> VÃ­tejte (Welcome) ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mark, and I work in the area of IT Governance and Compliance for some of the largest companies globally as an Independent Consultant, while at a same time I provide DevOps, SecOps and SysOps consulting services to smaller companies as sort of a paid hobby.

In addition, I spend a lot of time [in the Blockchain industry](/2nd-Layer), where I am mostly interested in [proof-of-stake distributed ledgers](/2nd-Layer/cardano-core-integration-testing) and systems of governance that could change the fabric of society. Perhaps in a generation or two leveraging the advancements in Zero Knowledge Cryptography that could enable private, cryptographically verifiable, frequent elections of the representative and executive branch of both governments and corporations, perhaps even society build around principles of liquid democracy.
